// Create an object that describes time (hours, minutes, seconds), and the following methods for
// working with this object: 

//A method for displaying the time. 
//A method for changing the time by a given amount of seconds. 
//A method for changing the time by a given amount of minutes.  
//A method for changing the time by a given amount of hours. 



//Note that in the last three methods changing one part may influence another. For example, if we add 30
//seconds to «20:30:45», we should get «20:31:15», not «20:30:75».
